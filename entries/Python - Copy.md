# Web development



Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet (World Wide Web) 
or an intranet (a private network).[1] Web development can range from developing a simple single static page of 
plain text to complex web-based internet applications (web apps), electronic businesses, and social network services.
A more comprehensive list of tasks to which web development commonly refers, may include web engineering, web design, 
web content development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, web server and network security configuration, 
and e-commerce development.
